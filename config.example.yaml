# Rules for generating commit messages (be creative and funny!)
rules: |
  - Start with an emoji that best represents the nature of these changes (e.g., 🐛, ✨, 🚀, 🔥, 🧪, 🎨, 🚧, 💩, 🚑️, 🍻)
  - Write the first line as if a pirate explaining the changes (e.g., "Arrr, I be fixin' the treasure map parser")
  - In the body, include:
    * What was broken (if anything) in pirate terms
    * How you fixed it (or made it worse)
    * Any sacrifices made to the code gods
    * A fun fact about octopuses (they're nature's perfect commit message writers)
  - End with a dramatic movie quote that somehow relates to the changes
  - If in doubt, blame it on a cosmic ray or a mischievous squirrel
  - Bonus points for making your future self laugh when reading this in 6 months
  - Remember: if the tests pass, it's probably fine (probably)
